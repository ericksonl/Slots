This is a fun slot machine GUI. To run, ensure that you have access to the Java.AWT library.
Export files to a JAVA IDE or similar program that will run java code.
When compiled and run, a GUI will appear on your screen. You can bet a coin, up to four, and pull the handle. The reel numbers will be displayed at the top of the screen. Winnings will be displayed below the reels, as well as the total winnings so far. You may reset the machine at any time.
